INTRODUCTION

With the exponential growth of road traffic and the increasing demand for real-time traffic monitoring, Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) have become essential tools to improve road safety and optimize traffic flow. At the core of these systems lies the need for accurate, robust, and reliable data on vehicular and pedestrian movement.

Traditionally, traffic monitoring systems have relied on single-sensor configurations, such as cameras or radar. However, these systems face limitations:

    Cameras provide rich visual data but struggle in adverse conditions (e.g., low lighting, fog, rain).

    Radar sensors, while robust in poor visibility, lack detailed resolution, making object identification difficult.

To address these limitations, this introduces a spatial synchronous infusion approach that integrates one camera and one radar sensor into a unified traffic monitoring platform. The goal is to leverage the complementary strengths of these sensors—combining visual richness with reliable depth and motion data—to create a robust perception framework.

By aligning and synchronizing both spatial and temporal data streams, the proposed approach enhances object detection and interpretation under diverse environmental conditions. This enables accurate identification of object speed, distance, and classification.

The integration offers a cost-effective alternative to complex multi-sensor arrays, making it scalable and practical for broader urban deployment. Furthermore, it supports critical ITS applications and autonomous vehicle systems that demand high reliability and adaptability.

The sensor fusion architecture comprises core components:

    Data Alignment and Synchronization

    Data Fusion Algorithms

    Real-Time Mapping

    Validation and Error Correction

    Adaptive Scalability

This introduction sets the foundation for the development of an innovative sensor fusion model designed to advance the performance and practicality of intelligent traffic systems.
